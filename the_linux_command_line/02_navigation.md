- `cd`: changes the working directory to your home directory
- `cd -`: changes the working directory to the previous working directory
- `cd ~user_name`: changes the working directory to the home directory of `user_name`
# Navigation
- Like Windows, a Unix-like operating system such as Linux organizes its files in what is called a *hierarchical directory structure*
    - This means they are organized in a tree-like pattern of directories (folders)
- The first directory in the file system is called the *root* directory
- Unlike Windows, which has a separate file system tree for each storage device, Unix-like systems such as Linux always have a **single file system tree**, regardless of how many drives or storage devices are attached to the computer
- `pwd`: print working directory
- When we first log in to our system (or start a terminal emulator session), our current working directory is set to our *home* directory. Each user account is given its own home directory, and it is the only place a regular user is allowed to write files
- `ls`: list directory contents
- `cd`: change directory
- Absolute pathnames
    - An absolute pathname begins with the root directory (represented by the leading slash `/` in the pathname) and follows the tree branch by branch until the path to the desired directory or file is completed
- Relative pathnames
    - A relative pathname starts from the working directory
    - The `.` notation refers to the working directory, and the `..` notation refers to the working directory’s parent directory
    - In general, if we do not specify a pathname to something, the working directory will be assumed. We can omit the `./` part because it is **implied**
- Filenames that begin with a period `.` character are **hidden** (`ls -a`)
- Filenames and commands in Linux, like Unix, are case sensitive
- Though Linux supports long filenames that may contain embedded spaces and punctuation characters, limit the punctuation characters in the names of files you create to **period, dash, and underscore**. Most important, do not embed spaces in filenames. If you want to represent spaces between words in a filename, use underscore characters
- Linux has **no concept of a “file extension”** like some other operating systems. You may name files any way you like. The contents or purpose of a file is determined by other means
    - Although Unix-like operating systems don’t use file extensions to determine the contents/purpose of files, many application programs do
